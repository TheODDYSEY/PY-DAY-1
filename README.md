This Python script allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user.

## Operations Supported

1. **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
3. **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.

2. Select the operation by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for division).
3. Enter the two numbers when prompted.
4. The result of the selected operation will be displayed.

## Example

```
Select operation:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
Enter choice(1/2/3/4): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0
```
